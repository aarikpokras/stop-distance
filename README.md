# Stopping Distance Simulator
Uses an Euler integrator to predict stopping distance ground track (tuned for the Apollo LM's DPS, but can be used for anything I guess)

## Presentation
The results of the simulator are outputted in the following format:
```
VAR  UNIT    VALUE
------------------
V    M/S  =  -0.22342356
```

Of course, ideally, velocity should be zero by the end of the simulation, but this is not possible with this method of numerical integration.

The stopping distance is also presented in many units, namely:
* Meters (M)
* Kilometers (KM)
* Nautical miles (NMI)
* Lunar equatorial degrees of longitude (marked with EQDLNG)

During the simulation, values will be outputted in the following format:
```
Iteration {iter}
t     = time
a     = acceleration
ax    = horizontal component of acceleration vector
theta = pitch angle
d     = distance traveled
v     = velocity
```

## Problems
* Assumes a non-rotating Moon (very big problem).
* This model predicts 194 nmi of stopping distance, and that's about 60 nmi off from the actual Apollo telemetry. Also, to my knowledge, the Apollo missions didn't even cancel out all of their horizontal velocity in this phase of flight, making this model even more inaccurate.
  * Possible causes:
    * Assumes linear pitch change rate
    * Assumes a non-rotating Moon
    * Assumes a flat Moon (not *that* big of a problem)
    * Does not change mass rate (mdot) based on variable thrust (problem because of the 26-second low-thrust period after PDI)
    * Assumes perfectly flat orbital trajectory (basically ignores arc distance traveled over Moon)

Hopefully it adds to the merit of this project that I also included the 26-second low-thrust period after powered descent ignition (PDI) as a sigmoid.

## Customize this for your own usage
* If constant thrust, uncomment the thrust variable, comment out the thrust function, and change `thrust(t)` to `thrust` in the first line of the loop.
* By reversing the same method, you can make any of these variables variable.

nasa pls hire&nbsp;&nbsp;soon i will make a verlet 4bp integrator 🙏
